## Lolcommits -> Gif

A small python script that takes a directory name with [lolcommits](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits) jpg images, and outputs an animated, looping gif.

Since it's a once-off thing, it's not very customizable through the command-line, and you'll have to edit the code (or make a pull request!) if you'd like to adjust some of the options.
